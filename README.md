Networking I Game

This project is an attempt to gamify the concepts from the Networking I class.  It will cover MAC addresses, IP addresses, subnetting, the OSI model, basic header questions, basic command questions, ANDing, magic number and anything we can think of to jam in there to help introduce students new to learning networking or brushing up on skills before Networking II.
